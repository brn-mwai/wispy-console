Hyper-realistic cinematic 4K product photograph. On a premium dark walnut desk: the Logitech MX Creative Console keypad unit (compact dark graphite matte body on integrated kickstand, 9 square LCD buttons in a 3x3 grid -- each displaying a different glowing icon in cyan #00DDFF and magenta #FF00E9 on black backgrounds: code brackets, checkmark, rocket, magnifying glass, X mark, microphone, chart, lightning bolt, brain. Two small paging buttons at the bottom, "logi" logo, USB-C braided cable). Beside it: the separate MX Creative Console dial unit (square dark graphite base, large flat brushed aluminum dial in the center with a glowing cyan LED ring around its base, two small round buttons flanking the dial, one rocker button at top). Further right: the Logitech MX Master 4 mouse (dark graphite ergonomic shape, MagSpeed metal scroll wheel, green LED dot, textured concentric-ring thumb rest). Behind the devices: a widescreen monitor displaying lines of code in a dark terminal with cyan syntax highlighting. Soft volumetric light spills from the monitor onto the devices. The LCD buttons cast small pools of colored light on the desk. Shallow depth of field. Cool blue ambient light with warm orange rim light from the left. Moody cinematic atmosphere.

The surrounding 8 LCD buttons show dimmer icons -- code brackets, rocket, magnifying glass, microphone, brain -- in blue and magenta tones on black backgrounds. The two small paging buttons are visible at the bottom. The USB-C braided cable runs off-frame. Background: blurred dark workspace with warm bokeh from a monitor showing code. Shallow depth of field focused tightly on the pressing finger and the glowing checkmark button. Dramatic cool blue side lighting. The decisive moment of approving an AI action. 4K cinematic product photography. No text.

Hyper-realistic cinematic 4K close-up of a developer's hand turning the large flat brushed aluminum dial on the Logitech MX Creative Console dial unit (separate square dark graphite matte base, the dial is wide and low-profile centered on the base, two small round buttons flank it, one small rocker button at the top edge). The thin LED accent ring around the dial's base glows with a gradient from cyan #00DDFF on the left to deep magenta #FF00E9 on the right, representing AI thinking depth. The hand is mid-rotation clockwise, fingertips gripping the brushed metal surface. In the soft background: the keypad unit with 9 glowing LCD buttons is slightly blurred, and a monitor shows flowing AI reasoning visualization. Volumetric light in blue and purple hues. Dark moody studio environment. The image conveys physically controlling how deeply an AI thinks. Cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field. No text.

## IMAGE 5: Split Reality -- Before and After
**Use: Problem statement / value proposition**
**Ratio: 16:9**

```
Hyper-realistic cinematic 4K split-screen composition. LEFT HALF: A frustrated developer hunched over a laptop in harsh white screen light, typing in a chat interface. Cluttered desk, cold sterile light. An MX Creative Console keypad (dark graphite, 9 LCD buttons all dark/off, on kickstand) and dial unit sit unused and disconnected beside the laptop. Stress and friction. RIGHT HALF: The same developer leaning back confidently. Their left hand rests on the MX Creative Console keypad with all 9 LCD buttons glowing vibrant cyan and magenta icons. The dial unit beside it has the aluminum dial with a bright cyan LED ring. Their right hand rests on the MX Master 4 mouse (dark graphite, MagSpeed wheel, green LED). The monitor behind shows code being written automatically with cyan text. Warm atmosphere with blue and orange accent lighting, calm and in control. A thin vertical line divides the halves. Cinematic lighting on both sides. The contrast between chaos and effortless control. No text.

**Ratio: 16:9**

```
Hyper-realistic cinematic 4K photograph. A developer holds down one of the 9 square LCD buttons on the MX Creative Console keypad (dark graphite on kickstand, 3x3 grid, USB-C cable) -- the pressed button glows magenta #FF00E9 showing a microphone icon. The developer is speaking, mouth slightly open mid-sentence. A subtle sound wave ripple effect in magenta light emanates from the glowing button. The other 8 LCD buttons show dimmer cyan icons. The dial unit sits beside the keypad, aluminum dial with blue LED ring. The monitor behind shows a voice waveform visualization in cyan on a dark background. The developer's other hand rests on the MX Master 4 mouse (dark graphite, metal scroll wheel, concentric-ring thumb rest). Dark moody workspace, blue ambient light. The intimacy of speaking directly to your AI through a physical button. Shallow depth of field on the hand and glowing magenta button. Cinematic. No text.

## IMAGE 8: Actions Ring -- Context-Aware Overlay
**Use: MX Master 4 Actions Ring section**
**Ratio: 16:9**

```
Hyper-realistic cinematic 4K photograph. A developer's right hand rests on the Logitech MX Master 4 mouse (dark graphite, MagSpeed metal wheel, green LED, concentric-ring thumb texture). Their thumb presses the side button, triggering an illuminated radial overlay menu that appears on-screen (visible on the blurred monitor behind). The radial overlay shows 5 glowing options arranged in a circle: code brackets icon (cyan), magnifying glass (cyan), rocket (orange), document (blue), terminal (magenta) -- each on a dark translucent ring. The overlay casts soft colored light reflections on the desk. Behind the mouse: the MX Creative Console keypad with glowing LCD buttons and the dial unit with aluminum dial are visible but soft-focused. A VS Code window with code is on the monitor. Dark workspace, volumetric blue light from the screen. The seamless bridge between physical thumb gesture and digital AI agent interface. Cinematic, shallow depth of field. No text.

The dial unit sits between the keypad and the keyboard (square base, large aluminum dial, blue LED ring). Their right hand rests on the MX Master 4 mouse (dark graphite, MagSpeed metal wheel, green LED dot). The room has warm ambient lighting from a wooden shelf with books and a small plant. Through floor-to-ceiling windows behind the desk: a sunset casts warm golden and orange light that contrasts with the cool blue glow of the screens and device LCDs. The developer looks focused but relaxed, in flow state, the AI working alongside them. Wide-angle environmental portrait. Cinematic teal-and-orange color grading. No text.
