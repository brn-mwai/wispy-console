# Wispy Console -- 1-Minute Video Script

**Total runtime: 55-60 seconds**

---

## Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:10)

**Visual:** Split screen. Left: person typing furiously in a chat window with an AI. Right: the same person's MX Creative Console sitting idle, unused.

**Voiceover:**
"AI agents can write code, research anything, and deploy projects. But the way we control them? We're still just... typing. Meanwhile, this sits on your desk doing nothing."

---

## Scene 2: The Solution (0:10 - 0:18)

**Visual:** Close-up of hands reaching for the MX Creative Console. Fingers press a glowing button. Screen shows Wispy activating.

**Voiceover:**
"What if you could control your AI agent with a button press? Wispy Console turns your MX Creative Console into an AI command center."

---

## Scene 3: Demo - Button Press (0:18 - 0:30)

**Visual:** Overhead shot of the MX Creative Console. Quick cuts between:
1. Press CODE button --> VS Code opens, agent starts writing code
2. Press RESEARCH button --> browser opens, agent searches and summarizes
3. Press APPROVE button --> code gets committed and deployed

**Voiceover:**
"Press Code -- the agent writes. Press Research -- it searches. Press Approve -- it ships. Nine buttons. Nine superpowers."

---

## Scene 4: Demo - The Dial (0:30 - 0:38)

**Visual:** Close-up of the dial being turned. On-screen overlay shows thinking depth gauge moving from "Flash" to "Deep Think." The AI response changes from a quick one-liner to a detailed analysis.

**Voiceover:**
"The dial controls how deeply the AI thinks. Quick answer? Turn left. Complex problem? Turn right. You feel the tradeoff between speed and depth."

---

## Scene 5: Demo - Voice + Haptics (0:38 - 0:46)

**Visual:** Person holds the Voice button, speaks "Build me a REST API with auth." Releases button. Agent starts working. MX Master 4 buzzes when done (show haptic animation overlay).

**Voiceover:**
"Hold Voice to speak your command. When the agent finishes, your MX Master buzzes. You don't even need to look at the screen."

---

## Scene 6: The Vision (0:46 - 0:55)

**Visual:** Wide shot. Person working naturally -- pressing buttons, turning dials, occasionally glancing at code being written automatically. The hardware and AI working together.

**Voiceover:**
"Wispy Console. The first AI plugin for Logitech. Because the future of AI isn't typing. It's touching."

---

## Scene 7: End Card (0:55 - 1:00)

**Visual:** Wispy ghost logo + MX Creative Console side by side.

**Text on screen:**
```
Wispy Console
AI Agent Control Center
for Logitech MX Creative Console

```

**Voiceover:**
"Wispy Console by Hausor Labs."

## Production Notes

- **Music:** Subtle, modern electronic ambient. No copyrighted music.
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Style:** Clean, dark theme matching Wispy's UI (dark bg, sky blue accents)
- **Key shots needed:**
  1. MX Creative Console buttons with custom icons/labels
  2. Screen recording of Wispy terminal responding to button presses
  3. Close-up of dial being turned
  4. MX Master 4 in hand (for haptic moment)
  5. Split-screen of hardware + AI output
- **If no physical hardware:** Use the Wispy webapp mockup (wispy-webapp.html) to simulate the console interface, with animated button presses and dial movements
